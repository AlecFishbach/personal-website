## Hi — I’m Alec.

I’m a computer science student focused on **machine learning systems, representation learning, and applied research**.

My interests sit at the intersection of:
- ML & statistical modeling
- systems (performance, scalability, infrastructure)
- real-world deployment constraints

I’m currently:
- working on research projects in ML and data-intensive systems  
- building long-horizon technical artifacts (code, papers, tools)  
- preparing for graduate-level research or frontier industry labs  

You can find my work below.

### Current Focus
- Robust representation learning under distribution shift  
- ML systems efficiency (training + inference)  
- Research-quality software engineering
